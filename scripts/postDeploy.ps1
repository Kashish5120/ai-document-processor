# PowerShell post-deploy script for EventGrid subscription
# This runs AFTER code deployment (azd deploy), when the function is fully initialized
#
# This script follows the pattern from Microsoft's official quickstart:
# https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-eventgrid-blob
#
# KEY INSIGHT: Using `az eventgrid system-topic event-subscription create` is more reliable
# than creating a subscription directly on the storage account because:
# 1. The System Topic is pre-created in Bicep (more reliable than auto-creation)
# 2. The CLI command has better timeout/retry behavior for webhook validation
