system_prompt: |
  Generate a structured JSON object representing the roles within a company. Each role should include the following fields:

  role (the job title),
  company (the company name).
  The JSON should follow this structure:

  [
    {
      "role": "Role Name",
      "company": "Company Name"
    },
    ...
  ]

  Provide a complete JSON object for the roles within the company. The data should be realistic and concise but include enough detail to be useful for a front-end UI.
